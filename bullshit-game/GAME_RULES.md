# 🎴 Bullshit Card Game - Rules

## 🎯 Objective
Be the first player to get rid of all your cards!

## 🎮 Setup
- 2-6 players
- Played with standard 52-card deck + 2 Jokers
- Cards are dealt evenly to all players

## 📜 How to Play

### Starting the Game
- The player with **2♣️ (2 of Clubs)** goes first
- Players take turns clockwise

### On Your Turn
1. Select cards from your hand (1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 cards only)
2. Choose what value to claim (must be same or higher than previous)
3. Click "Play Selected Cards"

**Example:**
- Previous player claimed "7"
- You can claim 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace
- You cannot claim 2-6 (too low)

### 🃏 Jokers (Wildcards)
- **Jokers can be ANY card you want!**
- They automatically count as the value you claim
- You can never be caught lying when using a joker
- Perfect for getting rid of cards you don't have!

### ⚠️ Checking (Calling Bullshit!)

**Any player can check the previous player** after they play cards.

**Click "Check Previous Player" button to challenge them!**

#### If They Were LYING:
- 🚨 Their cards are revealed
- They get their played cards back + 3 penalty cards
- They lose their turn (must play again)

#### If They Were TELLING THE TRUTH:
- ✅ Their cards are revealed  
- YOU get their played cards + 3 penalty cards
- YOU lose your turn (they play again)

**Think carefully before checking!** Wrong checks hurt you.

## 🎯 Valid Card Counts

You can ONLY play:
- **1 card**
- **3 cards**
- **4 cards**
- **5 cards**
- **6 cards**

❌ You CANNOT play 2 cards or more than 6 cards

## 💡 Strategy Tips

### When to Lie:
- You don't have the cards you need
- You want to get rid of multiple cards quickly
- You're confident no one will check you

### When to Check:
- Someone played a lot of cards quickly
- The claim seems impossible (like 6 Queens)
- Someone is close to winning
- You have a good feeling they're lying!

### Using Jokers:
- Save jokers for when you really need them
- Use them to claim high values (Kings, Aces)
- Perfect for playing when you have no valid cards
- Remember: Jokers can NEVER be caught as lies!

### General Tips:
- Watch how many cards other players have
- Remember what values have been played
- Don't check too often - penalties hurt!
- Bluff confidently - act like you're telling the truth
- Use the 3, 4, 5, 6 card plays to clear your hand faster

## 🏆 Winning

The first player to play all their cards wins the game! 🎉

## ⚙️ Technical Rules

### Turn Order After Check:
- **Liar caught:** Liar plays again (loses turn = goes back)
- **Truth told:** Checked player continues (checker loses turn)

### Penalty Cards:
- Always the played cards + 3 additional from deck
- Cards come from the remaining deck
- If deck runs out, only played cards are given

### Minimum Value:
- First play: Must be 2 or higher
- After first play: Must match or beat previous claim
- Resets after check resolution

## 🎲 Example Round

**Setup:**
- Alice has 2♣️, so she starts
- Bob, Carol, Dave also playing

**Round 1:**
- Alice: Plays 1 card, claims "2" ✅ (has 2♣️)
- Bob: Plays 3 cards, claims "5" (might be lying!)
- Carol: Checks Bob! ⚠️
- **Reveal:** Bob had 5♥️, 5♠️, 5♦️ (truth!)
- Carol gets 3 cards + 3 penalty = 6 cards total 😢
- Carol loses turn, Bob plays again

**Round 2:**
- Bob: Plays 4 cards, claims "6"
- Dave: Doesn't check (too risky)
- Alice: Plays 1 card, claims "7" (has Joker 🃏 - always safe!)
- Bob: Plays 3 cards, claims "9" 
- Carol: Checks Bob! ⚠️
- **Reveal:** Bob had 9♥️, 7♦️, 8♠️ (LYING! 🚨)
- Bob gets 3 cards + 3 penalty = 6 cards
- Bob loses turn and must play again

... game continues until someone runs out of cards!

## 🎉 Have Fun!

- Bluffing is part of the game
